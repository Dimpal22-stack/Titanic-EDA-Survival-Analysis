# Titanic Survival Analysis (EDA + ML)

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand key factors influencing passenger survival. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and a baseline machine learning model.

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
- Rows: 891
- Target: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Feature engineering (FamilySize)
- Logistic Regression model for survival prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rates
- Higher passenger class correlated with better survival
- Fare and family size influenced survival probability

## Model Performance
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~80%
